# NeonAlgo Lab (scaffold)

Initial folder/layout scaffold for NeonAlgo Lab.

## Structure
- `frontend/` – Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind scaffold with placeholder visualizer components.
- `backend/` – Django + DRF scaffold with placeholder algorithms/tests and API routes.
- `docker/` – Dockerfiles for frontend/backend plus sample Nginx config and compose file.

Next steps: flesh out algorithm generators (TS + Python), wire controls/metrics to hooks, expand API benchmarking, and document build/run instructions.
